    "### Problem 101: Optimum Polynomial\n",
    "<p>If we are presented with the first $k$ terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.</p>\n",
    "<p>As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function,<br>$u_n = n^3$: $1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, \\dots$</p>\n",
    "<p>Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that \"simple is best\" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be $15$ (common difference $7$). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.</p>\n",
    "<p>We shall define $\\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ to be the $n$<sup>th</sup> term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first $k$ terms of a sequence. It should be clear that $\\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for $n \\le k$, and potentially the <dfn>first incorrect term</dfn> (FIT) will be $\\operatorname{OP}(k, k+1)$; in which case we shall call it a <dfn>bad OP</dfn> (BOP).</p>\n",
    "<p>As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for $n \\ge 2$, $\\operatorname{OP}(1, n) = u_1$.</p>\n",
    "<p>Hence we obtain the following $\\operatorname{OP}$s for the cubic sequence:</p>\n",
    "<div class=\"margin_left\">\n",
    "<table><tr><td>$\\operatorname{OP}(1, n) = 1$</td>\n",
    "<td>$1, 1, 1, 1, \\dots$</td>\n",
    "</tr><tr><td>$\\operatorname{OP}(2, n) = 7n - 6$</td>\n",
    "<td>$1, 8, 15, \\dots$</td>\n",
    "</tr><tr><td>$\\operatorname{OP}(3, n) = 6n^2 - 11n + 6$     </td>\n",
    "<td>$1, 8, 27, 58, \\dots$</td>\n",
    "</tr><tr><td>$\\operatorname{OP}(4, n) = n^3$</td>\n",
    "<td>$1, 8, 27, 64, 125, \\dots$</td>\n",
    "</tr></table></div>\n",
    "<p>Clearly no BOPs exist for $k \\ge 4$.</p>\n",
    "<p>By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in <span class=\"red\"><b>red</b></span> above), we obtain $1 + 15 + 58 = 74$.</p>\n",
    "<p>Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:\n",
    "$$u_n = 1 - n + n^2 - n^3 + n^4 - n^5 + n^6 - n^7 + n^8 - n^9 + n^{10}.$$</p>\n",
    "<p>Find the sum of FITs for the BOPs.</p>"
